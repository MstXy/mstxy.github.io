**Unmono.** is a grey figure that user could interact everyday, changing the date, facial expression, gesture, clothes (including hat, tie, hoodie, and so on) and positions on a wood stand, to reflect the users true emotion behind the monotonous mask. The name "***Unmono***", is referring to the process of "being **not mono**tonous".
