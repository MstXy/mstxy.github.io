COVID-19 vaccines were expected to be effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death from coronavirus. For many countries, getting people vaccinated against COVID-19 has become one of the key objectives in combating the pandemic. However, did the mass vaccination effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19 and its related death? To address this concern, we proposed a visualization system for the health authorities, policymakers, and the general public. Our system illustrates the trends in vaccination rates in various countries associated with the number of reported COVID-19 cases, deaths, and the strictness of vaccination policy. Our visualization reveals that, as the vaccinated population grows, the number of confirmed deaths actually increases across the world, indicating the ineffectiveness of Covid vaccines.

Hope you enjoy it!
