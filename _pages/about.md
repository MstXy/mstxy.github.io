Hi! This is William Zhang, a current Master of Engineering student at [UC Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), under Data Science and System track. My undergraduate degree was taken at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/), with a dual Bachelor of Science degree in Data Science (Artificial Intelligence concentration, Honors) and Interactive Media Arts.

I find passion in a variety of things. Currently, I am doing research with [Berkeley VIP Lab](https://www-video.eecs.berkeley.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Avideh Zakhor](https://www-video.eecs.berkeley.edu/~avz/). Our research focus on `neural reconstruction` with vision-based drones and robots.

Previously, I was doing an internship at *DiFint Co., Ltd.*, working with `SLAM/Perception` algorithm research and development. The tasks mainly involve depth, optical flow, and pose estimation with deep CNN and ViTs.

In my undergraduate years, I was a `Computer Vision` research assistant mentored by [Prof.Guo Li](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/li-guo). My research is mainly in image/video semantic segmentation and few-shot segmentation, object detection, as well as transfer learning.

Apart from that, I was a Lab Technician in [IMA Department](https://ima.shanghai.nyu.edu/) for four years. My job mainly involves administrative works such as inventory system management, budget arrangement and human resources assistance; another big part is technical support on computers and audio-visual equipment for professors and students. as well as classroom planning.

I also do some software development and front-end back-end development, please see below for more information.

Nice to see you here!
