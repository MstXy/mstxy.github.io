Hi! This is William Zhang, a senior studying at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/), class of 2023. I am currently taking a double major in Data Science (with concentration in Artificial Intelligence) and Interactive Media Arts. 

I find passion in a variety of things. I am an undergraduate research assistant mentored by [Prof.Guo Li](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/li-guo). My research interest is mainly in `Computer Vision`, having past experience with image/video semantic segmentation and few-shot segmentation. 

Apart from that, I am also a Lab Technician in [IMA Department](https://ima.shanghai.nyu.edu/). My job mainly involves administrative works such as inventory system management, budget arrangement and human resources assistance; another big part is technicial support on computer and audio-visual equipment for professors and students.

Following my undergraduate experience, I’m likely to pursue a Master/PhD degree in Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence.

Nice to see you here!
